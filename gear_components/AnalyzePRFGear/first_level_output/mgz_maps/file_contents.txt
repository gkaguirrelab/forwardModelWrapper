- L/R_angle_map.mgz = Left/Right hemisphere original angle maps converted to subject's native space in .mgz format

- L/R_new_angle.mgz = Left/Right hemisphere angle maps that are interpolated while in Cartesian coordinates and converted back to Polar angles. Interpolated to subject's native space in .mgz format

- L/R_new_angle_converted.mgz = Thise are the final processed angle maps which are in -180 to 180 scale. This conversion is required for Bayesian Analysis gear.
