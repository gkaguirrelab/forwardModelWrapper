	"description": "Built from a MATLAB wrapper written for Kendrick Kay's AnalyzePRF script, this gear performs pRF analysis and allows ICA-fix zip archieves to be used as direct inputs. The gear looks for the cifti files in each of the separate run folders located in the ica-fix output and analyze all of them outputting an averaged result.mat file along with raw brain maps. If a threshold is specified, the gear also creates thresholded brain maps. Analysis of volumetric data is NOT currently supported.",
