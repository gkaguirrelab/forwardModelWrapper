Gear building instructions: 


1 - Compile matlab code:

    . cd into construction_tools and run compile_mainPRF.py by calling 
 
    "python <path_to_this_function> <path_to_matlab_documents> <output_folder>" 

    from the terminal. Save the output in a folder named func_input. The name
    of the folder matters as the docker container looks for it.


2 - Move func_input folder into AnalyzePRFGear_frame. 


3 - Build the docker image:

    . cd into AnalyzePRFGear_frame if you haven't already and run 
    
    "docker build -t <imagename> ." 


4 - Create the gear:

    . delete everything in the main_gear folder. These are the files from the previous
    version of the gear
    . cd into main_gear folder or any other empty folder if you haven't already. 
    The folder MUST be empty. If you follow the rest of these instructions in a folder
    that is not empty, you will overwrite files and permenantly delete them. 
    . make sure you are in an empty directory and from the terminal call

    "fw login"

    and login to flywheel. Then, type:

    "fw gear create" 

    and follow the instructions. Select "Other" as the base image and type the name of 
    the image you created at step 3. To upload the gear type the following. If you upload
    the same gear with different APIs, they will become separate gears (I guess) so beware.  

    "fw gear upload"
