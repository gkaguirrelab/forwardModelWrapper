	"description": "Built from a MATLAB wrapper written for Kendrick Kay's AnalyzePRF script, this gear performs pRF analysis and allows ICA-fix zip archives to be used as direct inputs. The gear looks for the cifti files in each of the separate run folders located in the ica-fix archive and outputs an results.mat file along with raw brain maps and diagnostic images.",
